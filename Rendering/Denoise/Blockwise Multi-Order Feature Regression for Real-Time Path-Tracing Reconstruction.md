# Blockwise Multi-Order Feature Regression for Real-Time Path-Tracing Reconstruction

## Introduction

In this article we propose a new regression-based reconstruction pipeline optimized for 1 spp input images that runs in real time on desktop GPUs.

## Reconstruction Pipeline

The proposed reconstruction pipeline can be divided into three main phases:

-   preprocessing
-   feature fitting
-   post-processing

### Input

The input is a 1spp path-traced frame and its accompanying feature buffers. The 1 spp frames are generated by using a rasterizer for producing the primary rays and feature buffers.

Before inputting the 1 spp input to our post-processing pipeline, we remove the first-bounce albedo from it, which is a common practice.
